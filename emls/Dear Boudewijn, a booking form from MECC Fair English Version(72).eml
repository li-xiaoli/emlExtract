 <a href=" http://iscooterskeywest.com/key-west-kruiser/ ">eater lost how to order xanax bars online random substitute</a>  Critics accused Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, of turning into a dictator and subverting their hard-won democracy to suit the religious beliefs of his Muslim Brotherhood party. They say he failed to provide for their safety, turned Egypt into a beggar state economically and failed to prosecute abuses by security forces against anti-government protesters who brought down dictator Hosni Mubarak in 2011. In 2012 he assembled a committee to write Egypt's new constitution that was dominated by the Brotherhood members who refused to make concessions to women and secularists. In November he assumed vast new powers placing himself above the review of the nation's highest court. He did nothing to stop violence of the Muslim Brotherhood against opponents, Tamarod members say. With the nation paralyzed by protests, unemployment rampant and foreign investment and tourism drying up, the military ousted Morsi it said to "restore democracy."
